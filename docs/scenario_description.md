For 2.4 My islands some instances of species are not tagged as missing (which they would be, if the island age were 1.2) because those branching times can be included. As an example compare the Pagiopalus_atomarius_Pagiopalus_sp clade between scenarios 1.1.1 and 1.2.1.

Never favouring MaxAge implies that MinAges are never used when a precise colonisation age is known.
