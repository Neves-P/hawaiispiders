# hawaiispiders 0.0.0.9001

* First minimal functionality. Main function `run_spider_analysis()` works. Four
different DAISIE model specifications are possible. This function can only be 
called locally as no bash scripts are available yet.
* Added first functioning spider scenario (scenario 1). At the moment this is
the only scenario with available data that can run in `run_spider_analysis()`.
* Add minimal documentation, tests and coverage check.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
